**⚠️ Do not merge yet! ⚠️**

This pull request looks great so far. ✨ You've just edited the _config.yml file! As you work more with Jekyll, you'll see that the _config.yml file is very important and can hold a lot of information.

We have some more work to do to create your blog. You can continue to make commits on your fredsiika-patch-2 branch, and the pull request will update automatically.

⌨️ **Activity: Add some content to your blog**
  1. On the "Code" tab, select your fredsiika-patch-2 branch

  2. Click **Create new file**

  3. Name the file _posts/YYYY-MM-DD-title.md, but replace the YYYY-MM-DD with today's date, and title with the title you'd like to use for your first blog post

  - Jekyll is very particular about how you title blog posts. They must follow the convention shown above.

  4.Type a quick draft of whatever you'd like to blog about. Remember, you can always edit it later

  5. Scroll to the bottom and commit your changes to your branch
